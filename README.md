Start a new project with `File` → `New…` (`⌘ N`) and customise as required. There are five core sections to the default layout

1. Toolbox
1. Tool options
1. Canvas
1. Panel for brushes, patterns, and gradients
1. Panel for layers, channels, paths, and undo

The **toolbox**, located at the top left, contains tools for manipulation and selection. Below this are the **tool options**, which allows the current tool to be customised. The **canvas**, the primary editing area in the center, will display the composition. The panel for **brushes**, **patterns**, and **gradients** is located at the top right – and finally, below this is the panel for **layers**, **channels**, **paths**, and **undo**.

## Toolbox

There are four main categories of tool:

1. **Selection**: Isolate an area of a composition for targeted editing
1. **Paint**: Change the composition directly by drawing, painting or erasing
1. **Transform**: Adjust an active layer, selection area, or path – alter scaling or perspective, for example
1. **Miscellaneous**: Zooming, defining colors, drawing curves, adding text, etc.

## Menu bar

To open an existing image as a new composition, navigate to `File` → `Open…` (`⌘ O`). To open an image into the current project as a layer, use `File` → `Open as Layers…` (`⌥ ⌘ O`). To export a composition, navigate to `File` → `Export As…` (`⇧ ⌘ E`). From here, expand the `Select File Type (By Extension)` drop-down, and choose an appropriate file type.

There are two items on the main menu panel that are of particular importance, the `Colors` tab and the `Filters` tab. `Colors` contains an array of common image adjustment tools, including some staples such as:

- `Color Balance…`
- `Hue-saturation…`
- `Shadows-highlights…`
- `Brightness-contrast…`
- `Levels…`
- `Curves…`

The `Filters` menu contains two types of filters, those which apply to an entire image, and those that only apply to the selected layer (or are overlaid on top of the composition as a separate layer). Some common filters include:

- `Blur` → `Gaussian Blur…`
- `Enhance` → `Sharpen (Unsharp Mask)…`
- `Light and Shadow` → `Drop Shadow…`
- `Light and Shadow` → `Long Shadow…`
- `Light and Shadow` → `Vignette…`
- `Map` → `Little planet…`
- `Animation` → `Playback…` (animated GIFs)
