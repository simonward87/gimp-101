Start a new project with `File > New...` (or `⌘ N`) and customise as required. There are five core sections to the default layout

1. Toolbox
1. Tool options
1. Canvas
1. Panel for layers, channels, paths, and undo
1. Panel for brushes, patterns, and gradients

The **toolbox**, located at the top left, contains tools for manipulation and selection. Below this are the **tool options**, which allows the current tool to be customised. The **canvas**, the primary editing area in the center, will display your composition. The panel for **layers**, **channels**, **paths**, and **undo** is located at the top right – and finally, below this is the panel for **brushes**, **patterns**, and **gradients**.
